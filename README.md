# PROMO-STEEM WEBSITE

The promo-steem github repository is here for all the work that is being done relating to the STEEM #promo-steem tag, and the Steem Ambassador programme. 

<h2>Overview of the programme: </h2>



    To provide a mechanism whereby Steem and the Steem community can reward promoters for doing high quality promotional work.
    To provide a location for Steem promoters and Steem whales who support promotional work to congregate.
    To assist with the organisation, support and communication of promotional initiatives for Steem and Steemit.

The site structure shall minimize number of sub-pages and maximise simplicity and a flat hierarchical structure where possible, using a simple hub and spoke structure with the home page as the hub.

<h3>Home Page</h3>

The home page shall focus on summarizing the goals and main functions of the promo-steem website

A method of removing spam from the current #promo-steem tag shall be adopted.  This may have to be done via manual selection initially, however shall incorporate a community voting process (see below) as the site progresses.

<h3>On-boarding Page</h3>

Shall include multiple methods for on-boarding to Steem.  The aim is to allow for all Steem promoters to have a one stop shop in order to onboard each type of potential new user they encounter.  This includes but is not limited to the following:

    “I was introduced to Steemit by” - allows us to keep a record of which Steemians on-board the most new comers

    Various sign up options:
    Anon Steem
    SteemInvite.com
    Standard sign up.
    Accounts pre-charged with Steem to avoid multi exchange fiat - Steem purchase.

 

<h3>Resources Area</h3>

    Steemit help links
    Community Links
    Whale shares, steemnow, steemcool links
    Welcome page
    Promotion methods
    Others….

 

<h3>Steem Ambassador Programme</h3>

Shall include the selection process (to include community), limited section criteria and instructions on how to apply / pitch to be a Steem Ambassador.

As the site progresses we should identify benefits / privileges & rewards of Steem Ambassadors

<h3>Guild</h3>

The Website shall include a simple description of the Guild with sign up option

<h3>Upcoming Promotional Events</h3>

<h3>Promoters Map of the World</h3>

Shall show the location of all Steemit Promoters on a map of world.

Promo-steem shall contact @steemitworldmap regards to promoters world map for potential integration, as this project has significant funding and recognition.

<h3>Artwork Area</h3>

Community to submit artwork for promo-steem.  This will enable promoters to easily download steem and steemit logos for use on promotion apparel.

<h3>Chat Area</h3>

A structured chat area which shall link from a discord channel. We should think about the structure of this prior to implementation and bring lessons learned from other chat areas. Implementation of an affective chat area is a complex matter and should be approached with a structure and strategy in mind.

A clear set of guides for how we want this chat area to run may be worth writing (possibly to include in the guidelines for use on the website)

    Public Area

This includes a longer term view on posting all public comments to the Steem blockchain so that most valuable can be up voted.  This will encourage Steemians to provide support to other users voluntarily in return for up votes.

    Private Area

An area for private messaging that is not useful to show publically such as meeting time arrangements and other items not for public viewing.

<h3>Newsletter</h3>

This area will link to the promo-steem centralised blog on steemit.com with a focus on news and updates in the promo initiative.  Additional comments welcome.

<h3>Applications Area</h3>

To include apps that we endorse, such as promo-trailing bot, promotion ideas / instructions

<h3>Promotional Merchandise Shop</h3>

Should allow for revenue gathering and the sale of Promo-steem apparel and steemit.inc apparel. Additional comments welcome.

<h3>Steem Whale Promo Bounty’s</h3>

Allow a place for Steem Whales to propose awards for promotional events / achievements such as getting the steem logo on TV at Glastonbury or making Steemit trend on reddit etc.

<h2>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</h2>

<h3>Voting Guild Community Up voting Process</h3>

The Promo-Steem core team shall propose Steem Ambassadors and request approval from the community.  Following approval, these Ambassadors shall have voting rights on the promo-steem voting guild.  Should any 3 of these members vote for the same promo-steem tagged blog a % of the guild’s vote shall be placed on said blog along with any trailing up votes from our trailing bot.  These blogs shall then be featured on the home page with options to sort by trending or by newest.

<h3>Referral Tracking</h3>

We shall develop an automated way of tracking the “I was introduced to Steemit by” tag on the on-boarding page. This will allow us to reward, promote and encourage the best performing Steemians.

<h3>Pre charged Steem Accounts</h3>

We should discuss the legal implications of using credit cards payments (or others) in return for the private keys to pre charged steem accounts.  Following this we need to obtain steem in order to provide a range of account sizes.  This should be made functional through the on-boarding page, such that upon payment receipt, they private key and account name, along with instructions on how to change the master key are sent to the email of the recipient.

<h3>Upcoming Promotional Events / Artwork / Promo Bounty</h3>

This should display upcoming promo events & Whale Bounty’s that have been blogged on steemit.com.  The promo event blogs & bounty’s should auto up load to the webpage based on scanning for a tag such as “#promo-event” and include the community up voting process above in order to avoid spamming to the tag.  For events we plan to use an eventbrite API to display promo steem events on our website.
